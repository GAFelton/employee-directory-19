# React Employee Directory
  ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/GAFelton/employee-directory-19)

  ## Description:

 This Employee Directory was built using create-react-app. The app allows the user to interact with a sample database of employee records (generated using https://randomuser.me/). Users can search and sort through the various user records based on first name, last name, or phone number. I used functional components, useState and useEffect to create this site.
